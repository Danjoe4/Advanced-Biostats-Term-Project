# Advanced-Biostats-Term-Project
This R file is a start-to-finish analysis on microbiome data. The script does some formatting and a few tests like Non-metric Multi-dimensional Scaling, ANOSIM, and an Indicator Species Analysis. Also included are some graphical outputs. More specifics, as well as the link to the final presentation, and my report, are in the README.
