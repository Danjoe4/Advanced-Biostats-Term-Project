# Advanced-Biostats-Term-Project
This is my start-to-finish analysis on microbiome data. The R script does some formatting and a few tests like Non-metric Multi-dimensional Scaling, ANOSIM, and an Indicator Species Analysis. The graphical outputs are included in the presentation pdf. The nine page report is also included, as well as the orginal and transformed data sets (txt and excel files)
